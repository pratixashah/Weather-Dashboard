# Web-Design
 
A visualization dashboard website using visualizations plotting weather data. This dashboard creates individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contains the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. A landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

  - A landing page containing:
    - An explanation of the project.
    - Links to each visualizations page. A sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
  - Four visualization pages, each with:
    - A descriptive title and heading tag.
    - The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
    - A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
  - A “Comparisons” page that:
    - Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
    - Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
    - The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
  - A “Data” page that:
    - Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
    - The table is a bootstrap table component.

The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:
  - Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
  - Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named “Plots” that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
  - Provides two more text links on the right: “Comparisons,” which links to the comparisons page, and “Data,” which links to the data page.
  - Is responsive (using media queries).
